I'll be the one that stays 'til the end
And I'll be the one that needs you again
And I'll be the one that proposes in a garden of roses
And truly loves you long after our curtain closes
But will you still love me when nobody wants me around?
When I turn 81 and forget things
Will you still be proud?
'Cause I am the one who's waited this long
And I am the one that might get it wrong
And I'll be the one that will love you
The way I'm supposed to, girl, oh
